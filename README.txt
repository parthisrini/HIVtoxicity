This repository has the Machine Learning programs developed for toxicity prediction. We call this as ADMET advisor, which is a software tool allows drug discovery scientists to better predict ADMET properties for new chemical compounds. 

By combining a novel implementation of artificial intelligence with comprehensive data collection capabilities, Vingyani will position itself as a trusted advisor to researchers throughout the drug discovery process. ADMET Advisor will provide researchers on-demand analytical support without interrupting their current workflow. The tool will enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology researchers to save time and money by identifying chemical compounds that are likely to fail before significant resources are invested. 

Vingyani will become the thought leader in applied artificial intelligence in the areas of pharmaceutical and biotechnology research. Our goal is to constantly expand our knowledge base and array of product offerings through ongoing research and development and alliances with academic research labs and national laboratories. 

Vingyani will position itself to the drug discovery industry as a supplier of superior technology at a premium price.  Our strengths lie in making flexible product architecture which enable easily customizable components based on customer specifications
